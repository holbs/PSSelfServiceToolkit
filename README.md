The Flamingo project ðŸ¦©. A set of PowerShell scripts can be deployed to Windows workstations to allow them to self heal some basic problems and get reports to assist the helpdesk when logging tickets. Deploy with Install.cmd and uninstall with Uninstall.cmd. Install creates a scheduled task to start SysTray.ps1 on login. Detection can be on the registry key HKLM\SOFTWARE\Flamingo. Further configuration may be needed to trust the scripts if you are using AppLocker or blocking script execution.
